#Code Golf
Welcome to Code Golf! In this competition, the goal is to write functioning code to solve a series
of increasingly difficult problems using the fewest lines possible. You may use any of the following languages:
* Python
* Javascript
* Java
* C
* C++

Your answers will be evaluated based on whether they pass all of the test cases for a problem, the number of
characters used in your solution, and the relative order of answers submitted. Answers will be ranked only
within their own language, and a live leaderboard will be made available online.
